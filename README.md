# gazebo_camera_example
This repository is for exhibiting my files for a stackexchange question regarding getting a minimal example of a camera in gazebo Harmonic/Garden to work.

How to run this code:
1. Install Docker
2. cd to this directory

**If you want to run this with Gazebo Harmonic:**

3. ```docker compose build gz_cam_harmonic```
4. ```docker compose up gz_cam_harmonic```

**If you want to run this with Gazebo Garden:**

5. ```docker compose build gz_cam_garden```
6. ```docker compose up gz_cam_garden```
